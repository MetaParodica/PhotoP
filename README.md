# PhotoP

An iPhone-first professional camera platform, with native Android planned after the photo pipeline is validated.

**Status: initial implementation; iPhone validation is still required.** The first slice contains an AVFoundation preview, physical-camera selection, JPEG capture, original-byte preservation, add-only Photos export, a thirds grid, and basic manual ISO/shutter/EV/focus/WB controls. It does not yet implement RAW, LUT rendering, long exposure, composition AI or video.

## Build on a Mac

Install Xcode with the iOS SDK and XcodeGen, then:

```sh
cd ios
xcodegen generate
open PhotoP.xcodeproj
```

Select a unique bundle ID and your signing team in Xcode; choose a physical iPhone running iOS 17 or later. The Simulator can run model tests but cannot validate the camera. No Apple account secrets belong in this repository.

The baseline is iOS 17, built in Swift 5 language mode with complete concurrency diagnostics. A serial queue owns AVFoundation state. Strict Swift 6 migration is a later, separately validated change.

Original JPEG bytes are retained in the app's Documents/Originals directory before Photos export. Deleting the app also deletes those app-local originals. A successful Photos export creates a separate Photos asset.

All 14 requested modes remain the product roadmap; the initial app exposes photo capture only. Frame duration, RAW/ProRAW, Log and maximum resolution depend on the device and active capture configuration.

Third-party project and LUT rights are tracked separately. No third-party source code, LUT binaries, model weights or commercial UI assets are bundled in this initial implementation.
